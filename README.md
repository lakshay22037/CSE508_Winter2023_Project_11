Image Retrieval and Audio Summarization for Blinds
Our project focused on similar image retrieval and audio summarization for the visually
impaired. We utilized an autoencoder and deep CNN classifier to extract image embeddings
from the CIFAR-100 dataset, and subsequently built an inverted index and performed
clustering. Using the KNN algorithm, we retrieved 5 similar images to the input image and
implemented an auto-play feature for the audio descriptions of these images using YOLOv3
and gtts.
